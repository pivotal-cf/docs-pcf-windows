##<a id='upgrade-apps'></a> Upgrade Windows Apps

Consult the following list of scenarios for instructions about upgrading your apps.

* If your .NET app was previously pushed with the `binary_buildback` and you are relying on the <code>WebAppServer.exe</code> you must push with the <code>hwc\_buildpack</code>:

    <pre class="terminal">$ cf push APP-NAME -s windows2012R2 -b hwc_buildpack</pre>
    By passing `windows2012R2` with the `-s` flag, you instruct PCF to run the app in the Windows cell. If you are not pushing your app from its directory, add the `-p` flag to specify the path to the directory that contains the app.
<br><br>
An app with the <code>hwc\_buildpack</code> should not be pushed with the <code>-c</code> flag.
<br><br>
If you try to <code>cf restage</code>, your app will fail to restage because you cannot switch to the <code>hwc\_buildpack</code> using <code>cf restage</code>.

* If you have a binary app you must push with the <code>-c</code> flag:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf push APP-NAME -s windows2012R2 -b binary_buildpack -c PATH-TO-BINARY
    </pre>

* If your app needs a custom start command and requires the <code>WebAppServer.exe</code>, you must update the start command to reflect the path to <code>hwc.exe</code>, which is provided by the HWC buildpack.
