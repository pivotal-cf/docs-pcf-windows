This topic describes how to troubleshoot Windows Diego cells deployed by Pivotal Application Service (PAS) for Windows.

##<a id='issues'></a> Installation Issues

Here are some issues and resolutions that one may run into during the installation process.

###<a id='winfs-injector-issues'></a>PAS for Windows File System Injector Troubleshooting

**Symptom**

You run the `winfs-injector` and see an error about certificates.
```
Get https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:cloudfoundry/windows2016fs:pull: x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided
```

**Explanation**

Local certificates are needed to communicate with Dockerhub.

**Solution**

Install necessary certificates on your local machine (on Ubuntu, this can be done via the `ca-certificates` package).

###<a id='no-os'></a>Missing Container Image

**Symptom**

You click the **+** icon in Ops Manager to add the PAS for Windows tile to the Installation Dashboard, and you see the error:

<%= image_tag('error-invalid-release-uninjected-tile.png') %>

**Explanation**

The product file you are trying to upload does not contain the Windows Server container base image.

**Solution**

1. Delete the product file listing from Ops Manager by clicking its trash can icon under **Import a Product**.

1. Follow the PAS for Windows [installation instructions](./installing.html#install) to run the `winfs-injector` tool locally on the product file. This step requires internet access, can take up to 20 minutes, and adds the Windows Server container base image to the product file.

1. Click **Import a Product** to upload the "injected" product file.

1. Click the **+** icon next to the product listing to add the PAS for Windows tile to the Installation Dashboard.

##<a id='log-types'></a> Windows Cell Log Types

Windows cells generate two types of logs:

* **BOSH job logs**, such as `rep_windows` and `consul_agent_windows`. These logs stream to the syslog server configured in the PAS tile **System Logging** pane, along with other PCF component logs. The names of these BOSH job logs correspond to the names of the logs emitted by Linux Diego cells.

* **Windows Event logs**. These stream to the syslog server configured in the PAS for Windows **System Logging** pane and are downloadable through Ops Manager, as described [below](#logs).

##<a id='logs'></a> Access Windows Event Logs

PCF operators can access log messages from Windows Diego cells in two ways:

* Configure PAS for Windows to [send](#syslog) all Windows cell logs to an external syslog server.

* [Download](#download) archived logs from each Windows cell individually.

###<a id='syslog'></a> Send Cell Logs to a Syslog Server

To forward Windows cell log messages to an external syslog server, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.

1. Click the **PAS for Windows** tile.

1. Under the **Settings** tab, select the **System Logging** pane.
  <%= image_tag("win-syslog-config.png") %>

1. Under **Enable Syslog for VM logs?**, click **Enable**

1. Under **Address**, enter the IP address of your syslog server.

1. Under **Port**, enter the port of your syslog server. The typical port for a syslog server is `514`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The host must be reachable from the PAS network. Ensure your syslog server listens on external interfaces.</p>

1. Under **Protocol**, select the transport protocol to use when forwarding logs.

1. Click **Save**.

###<a id='download'></a> Download Cell Logs

Perform the following steps to retrieve the logs from a Windows cell:

1. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard.
1. Click the **PAS for Windows** tile.
1. Click the **Status** tab.
1. Under the **Logs** column, click the download icon for the Windows cell you want to retrieve logs from.
1. Click the **Logs** tab.
1. When the logs are ready, click the filename to download them.
1. Unzip the file to examine the contents. Each component on the cell has its own logs directory:
	* `/consul_agent_windows/`
	* `/garden-windows/`
	* `/metron_agent_windows/`
	* `/rep_windows/`

##<a id='rdp'></a> Connect to a Windows Cell

Perform the following steps to connect to a Windows cell to run diagnostics:

1. Download and install a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) client.
	* For Mac OS X, download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id715768417?mt=12).
	* For Windows, download the Microsoft Remote Desktop app from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps).
	* For Linux/UNIX, download a RDP client like [rdesktop](http://www.rdesktop.org/).

1. Follow the steps in the [Log into BOSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#log-in) section of the <em>Advanced Troubleshooting with the BOSH CLI</em> topic to log in to your BOSH Director. The steps vary slightly depending on whether your PCF deployment uses internal authentication or an external user store.

1. Retrieve the IP address of your Windows cell using the BOSH CLI. Run the following command, replacing `MY-ENV` with the alias you assigned to your BOSH Director:
    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh -e MY-ENV -d garden-windows
    Using environment 'DIRECTOR-IP' as client 'admin'

    Name               Release(s)       Stemcell(s)    Team(s)  Cloud Config
    garden-windows     ...              ...            -        latest
    </pre>

1. Retrieve the Administrator password for your Windows cell by following the steps for your IaaS:
	* On vSphere, this is the value of `WINDOWS_PASSWORD` in the `consumer-vars.yml` file you used to previously build a stemcell.
	* On Amazon Web Services (AWS), navigate to the AWS EC2 console. Right-click on your Windows cell and select **Get Windows Password** from the drop-down menu. Provide the local path to the `ops_mgr.pem` private key file you used when installing Ops Manager and click **Decrypt password** to obtain the Administrator password for your Windows cell.
	* On Google Cloud Platform (GCP), navigate to the Compute Engine Dashboard. Under **VM Instances**, select the instance of the Windows VM. At the top of the page, click on **Create or reset Windows password**. When prompted, enter "Administrator" under **Username** and click **Set**. You will receive a one-time password for the Windows cell.
	* You cannot RDP into Windows cells on Azure.

1. Open your RDP client. The examples below use the Microsoft Remote Desktop app.

1. Click **New** and enter your connection information:
	<%= image_tag('rdp-connect.png') %>
	* **Connection name**: Enter a name for this connection.
	* **PC name**: Enter the IP address of your Windows cell.
	* **User name**: Enter `Administrator`.
	* **Password**: Enter the password of your Windows cell that you obtained above.

1. To mount a directory on your local machine as a drive in the Windows cell, perform the following steps:
	1. From the same **Edit Remote Desktops** window as above, click **Redirection**.
	1. Click the plus icon at the bottom left.
	<%= image_tag('rdp-redirection.png') %>
	1. For **Name**, enter the name of the drive as it will appear in the Windows cell. For **Path**, enter the path of the local directory.
	1. Click **OK**.

1. Close the **Edit Remote Desktops** window and double-click the newly added connection under **My Desktops** to open a RDP connection to the Windows cell.

1. In the RDP session, you can use the [Consul CLI](#consul) to diagnose problems with your Windows cell.

###<a id='consul'></a> Consul CLI

Perform the following steps to use the Consul CLI on your Windows cell to diagnose problems with your Consul cluster:

1. In your RDP session, open a PowerShell window.
1. Change into the directory that contains the Consul CLI binary:
	<pre class="terminal">
	PS C:\Users\Administrator> cd C:\var\vcap\packages\consul-windows\bin\
	</pre>
1. Use the Consul CLI to list the members of your Consul cluster:
	<pre class="terminal">
	PS C:\Users\Administrator\var\vcap\packages\consul-windows\bin\> .\consul.exe members
	Node                       Address          Status  Type    Build  Protocol  DC

	diego-cell-0               10.0.0.103:8301  alive   client  0.6.4  2         dc1
	diego-cell-1               10.0.0.104:8301  alive   client  0.6.4  2         dc1
	diego-cell-2               10.0.0.107:8301  alive   client  0.6.4  2         dc1
	diego-database-0           10.0.0.92:8301   alive   client  0.6.4  2         dc1

	router-0                   10.0.0.105:8301  alive   client  0.6.4  2         dc1
	uaa-0                      10.0.0.93:8301   alive   client  0.6.4  2         dc1
	</pre>
1. Examine the output to ensure that the `cell-windows-0` service is registered in the Consul cluster and is `alive`. Otherwise, your Windows cell cannot communicate with your PCF deployment and developers cannot push .NET apps to the Windows cell. Check the configuration of your Consul cluster, and ensure that your certificates are not missing or misconfigured.
