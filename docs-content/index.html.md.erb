<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This documentation describes how operators install and manage Windows [cells](../concepts/architecture/index.html#diego-cell) in Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) with PCF Runtime for Windows, and how developers push .NET apps to Windows cells.

Operators can install PCF Runtime for Windows on vSphere, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

Operators who want to run Windows cells in PCF to enable developers to push .NET apps can deploy the PCF Runtime for Windows tile.

Deploying this tile creates a separate BOSH deployment populated with the Garden Windows release, which runs on a Windows cell built from a Windows stemcell.

Once the Windows cell is running, developers can specify a Windows stack when pushing .NET apps from the command line. PCF passes the app to the Windows cell in the Garden Windows BOSH deployment. The diagram below illustrates the process.

The minimum resource requirement for each Windows cell:

- Disk size: 64&nbsp;GB
- Memory: 16&nbsp;GB
- CPUs: 4

## <a id='issues'></a>Known Issues

PCF Runtime for Windows has the following known issues:

* Windows cells can host a maximum of 40 app instances.

* In the PCF Runtime for Windows tile **Credentials** tab, for either **Windows Diego Cell** or **Install HWS Buildpack Errand**, the `vcap` credentials that appear when you click **VM Credentials** > **Link to Credential** are meaningless. Windows cells have no vcap user.

* The controls in the **Advanced Features** pane have no effect.

* Under **VM Options** > **Manage Administrator Password** > **Set the password**, setting the admin user password has the following limitations:

  - Azure and GCP: setting the password does not work. You can only **Use random administrator password**.

  - AWS and vSphere: the password must be 8-14 characters; and must use letters, numbers and the `!` character, which is the only allowed special character.
