## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

A "stemcell" is a customized operating system image containing the filesystem for BOSH-managed virtual machines. When deployed, it includes a process, the _BOSH Agent_, which is pre-configured to communicate with the orchestrating VM, the _BOSH Director_.
The BOSH Agent is responsible for executing and monitoring "jobs" on the VM.

Deployments of Windows Server on PCF currently use a stemcell containing Windows Server 2012R2.

## <a id="sizing"></a> Root Disk Sizing

The size of your stemcell's root disk determines the root disk size of any VM that the stemcell can create. The relationship between a stemcell's disk size and the root disk size of the Windows cells that it creates depends on your IaaS, as shown in the table below.

<table id='disk-sizes' border="1" class="nice" >
  <tr>
    <th>IaaS</th>
    <th>Stemcell root disk size</th>
    <th>Possible root disk sizes for Windows cells</th>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>AWS</th>
    <td>30GB</td>
    <td>30GB or larger (for stemcell 1200.9 and later)</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>Azure</th>
    <td>127GB</td>
    <td>127GB</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>GCP</th>
    <td>50GB</td>
    <td>50GB or larger</td>
  </tr><tr>
    <th>vSphere</th>
    <td>Recommended 128GB+<sup>*</sup></td>
    <td>Same as stemcell minimum root disk size</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<sup>*</sup>Because you [create your own stemcell](./vsphere-stemcell-build.html) on vSphere, you can control its root disk size.


## <a id="light-stemcells"></a> Light Stemcells

"Light" stemcells are metadata files used on a public IaaS that enable users to reference and deploy a stemcell without uploading it manually.

Below is the documentation currently available for activating light stemcells for the Runtime for Windows tile:
