title: Windows Diego Cell architecture
owner: Windows
---
You can deploy the architecture of Windows Diego Cells that <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> uses to
to run containerized .NET apps and the stemcells that it supplies to BOSH
as the operating system for the Windows Diego Cell VMs.

You can run Windows Diego Cells in <%= vars.platform_name %> to enable developers to push .NET apps,
to deploy the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile.

When you deploy this tile, it creates a separate BOSH deployment populated with the Garden Windows release, which runs on a Windows
Diego Cell built from a Windows stemcell.

After the Windows Diego Cell is running,
developers can specify a Windows stack when pushing .NET apps from the command line.

<%= vars.platform_name %> passes the app to the Windows Diego Cell
in the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> BOSH deployment.

The following diagram illustrates the process:

## <a id="cells"></a> Windows cells

App instances in <%= vars.platform_name %> run inside containers. Garden is the API that creates and manages these containers. An implementation equivalent to that on Linux Diego Cells provides this infrastructure on Windows Diego Cells, using native Windows Server containers.

By installing the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile, operators create a Windows Diego Cell from a stemcell that contains the Windows Server operating system. Garden on Windows uses Windows containers to isolate resources on Windows Diego Cells that <%= vars.platform_name %> manages alongside Linux Diego Cells.

For more information about installing the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile, see [Installing and configuring <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>](installing.html).

## <a id="components"></a> Components

A Windows Diego Cell includes the following components:

* Guardian: Implements the Garden API on Windows.

* Loggregator Agent: Forwards app logs, errors, and metrics to the Loggregator system. For more information about the Loggregator Agent, see [Sends logs to Loggregator](../concepts/diego/diego-architecture.html#step-6) in _Diego components and architecture_. For more information about Loggregator, see [Loggregator architecture](../loggregator/architecture.html).

* BOSH Agent: Executes instructions from the BOSH Director. For more information, see [Agent](https://bosh.io/docs/bosh-components/#agent) in _Components of BOSH_ in the BOSH documentation.

* Diego Rep: For more information, see [Tasks and long-running processes](../concepts/diego/diego-auction.html#processes) in _How Diego Balances App Processes_.

### <a id="container"></a> Container implementation

Garden on Windows uses these runtime plug-ins to create and manage Windows containers for <%= vars.app_runtime_full %>:

* Container plug-in `winc`: Creates Open Container Initiative (OCI)-compliant containers, executes processes in the containers, and sets their CPU and RAM limits. For more information about OCI compliance, see the [Open Container Initiative](https://www.opencontainers.org) website.

* Network plug-in `winc-network`: Creates a network compartment for the container, applies its DNS settings, and defines its inbound and outbound network access rules.

* Rootfs image plug-in `groot`: Sets up the container file system volume and uses the File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) API to define its disk usage quotas. For more information about the FSRM, see the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/fsrm/fsrm-overview).

* Rootfs image plug-in `groot`: Sets up the container file system volume and uses the File Server Resource Manager (FSRM) API to define its disk usage quotas.

### <a id="stemcells"></a> Windows stemcells

A stemcell is a customized operating system image containing the file system for BOSH-managed VMs.
When deployed, the operating system includes the BOSH Agent process,
which is dedicated to communicating with the orchestrating VM, the BOSH Director.
The BOSH Agent runs and monitors BOSH jobs on its VM.

Deployments of Windows Server on <%= vars.platform_name %> use a stemcell containing Windows Server 2019.

For more information about obtaining or creating a stemcell for <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>, see [Downloading or creating Windows stemcells](./stemcells.html).
