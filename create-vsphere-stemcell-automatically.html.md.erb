title: Creating a Windows stemcell for vSphere using stembuild
owner: Windows
---

A BOSH stemcell is a versioned operating system image.

You must create a BOSH stemcell for Windows before you can deploy these products on vSphere:

* <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>)
* <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) with Windows workers in Kubernetes clusters

To create a Windows stemcell for vSphere, you create a base Windows VM from a volume licensed ISO and subsequently maintain that base template with all Windows-recommended security updates, but without the BOSH dependencies.

The Windows VM with security updates serves as the base for all future stemcells produced from clones of that base VM. This enables you to build new stemcells without having to run Windows updates from the beginning each time. You can also use a "snapshot" feature to maintain an updated Windows image that does not contain the BOSH dependencies.

VMware recommends installing any available updates and
then rebuilding the stemcell from a clone of the original VM.

The BOSH stemcell that you create in this topic is based on Windows Server 2019.
If you already have a BOSH stemcell for Windows on vSphere, see [Monthly stemcell upgrades](#upgrade-stemcell).

[Best Practices for Stembuild for Tanzu Application Service & Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/practitioners/best-practices-for-stembuild-for-tanzu-application-service-tanzu-kubernetes-grid-integrated-edition)
in _VMware Tanzu Tech Tutorials_.

## <a id='stembuild-overview'></a> Stembuild overview

Stembuild is a binary that you use to build BOSH stemcells for Windows Server 2019.

Stembuild creates a BOSH stemcell from a base Windows image.
The stembuild CLI has two commands, construct and package,
which you run against a Windows Server 2019 VM.
[Step 4: Construct the BOSH stemcell](#construct-stemcell)
and [Step 5: Package the BOSH stemcell](#package-stemcell)
as follows explain how to run these commands.

Before using stembuild to create a stemcell, you must create a Windows Server 2019 VM and update the VM with the
latest Windows updates.
[Step 1: Create a base VM for the BOSH stemcell](#create-base-vm),
[Step 2: Configure the base VM](#install-windows-updates), and
[Step 3: Clone the base VM](#clone-vm) explain how to prepare the Windows Server 2019 VM.

## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you create a BOSH stemcell for Windows on vSphere, you must have:

* A vSphere environment that makes sure the VM hardware used by the stemcell is compatible
  with your deployment environment's ESXi/ESX host, and vCenter Server versions. For more information about the vSphere environment, see
  [ESXi/ESX hosts and compatible virtual machine hardware versions list (2007240)](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2007240) in the VMware Knowledge Base.

* An ISO for a Windows Server 2019 Server Core installation, build number: 17763,
  from [Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us) or
  [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC)](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx).
  The Windows Server 2019 ISO must be a clean, base ISO file.
  You can use an evaluation copy for testing, but VMware discourages an evaluation copy for production,
  because the licensing expires.
  For more information, see the [Windows Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started-19/get-started-19)
  or the [Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center](https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx) website.

  A clean ISO file has no custom scripts or tooling. For example, the ISO must have no logging or antivirus tools installed.

* A download of the `stembuild` command line interface (CLI) from a 2019.x release in [Stemcells
  (Windows)](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/stemcells-windows-server/) on <%= vars.product_network %>.
  * To build a Windows stemcell for <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>, use the vSphere `stembuild` CLI for Windows corresponding to both the operating system of your local host and the stemcell version that you want to build.
  * To build a Windows stemcell for <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>, use a Windows stemcell and `stembuild` CLI version listed as compatible
    in the **Product Snapshot** table in the release notes for your <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> version: [Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-Kubernetes-Grid-Integrated-Edition/index.html)

* Microsoft [Local Group Policy Object Utility (LGPO)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319) downloaded to the same folder as your `stembuild` CLI.

* The minimum vCenter user permissions required to use `stembuild` for vSphere stemcells, specifically:
  * `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Modify`
  * `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Execute`
  * `VirtualMachine.GuestOperations.Query`
  * `VirtualMachine.Config.AddRemoveDevice`
  * `VirtualMachine.Interact.SetCDMedia`
  * `VApp.Export`
  * `System.Anonymous`*
  * `System.Read`*
  * `System.View`*

Permissions designated with an `*` are generated when you create a new user in vCenter and cannot be set within the vCenter UI.

    To avoid this, shrink or minimize the CLI window while you are waiting.</p>

1. When prompted, follow the instructions to finish the installation.

1. To complete the installation, start the VM again.

## <a id='install-windows-updates'></a> Step 2: Configuring the base VM

Install all the Windows Server updates so that you have the latest, most secure,
version of the Windows Server operating system.

To configure the base VM network settings and install Windows updates:

1. From the vSphere Web Client, right-click the base VM and select **Open Remote Console**.

1. On the command line, enter `sconfig` to run the **SConfig** utility.

1. On the **Server Configuration** page, in **Network Settings**, enter `8`.

1. On the **Network Settings** pane:
    1. Under **Available Network Adapters**, enter the number that corresponds to your network adapter.
    1. Enter `1` to set the network adapter address.
    1. Enter `S` to set a static IP address.

1. On the vSphere Web Client, click **Actions**, then click **Edit Settings** on the VM.

1. In the **CD/DVD drive 1** row deselect the **Connected** check box. Do not remove the CD/DVD drive.

1. Restart the VM.

1. After the VM restarts verify that you can ping the IP address you assigned to the base VM.

## <a id='clone-vm'></a> Step 3: Clone the base VM

To clone the base VM:

1. From the vSphere Web Client, power off the base VM.
This is important because your base VM and the clone VM you create share the same IP address.

1. Right-click the base VM.

1. Click **Clone**, then click **Clone to Virtual Machine**. This clone is your target VM.

![Windows VM Actions menu](./images/clone-vm.png)

1. Save the base VM. You run Windows updates on this VM for future stemcells.

2. Take snapshots of both your base and target VMs.
If there is an issue when you run stembuild, use these snapshots to revert to a clean state.
For more information, see
[Managing snapshots in vSphere Web Client](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2032907#:~:text=To%20take%20a%20snapshot%20in,pool%2C%20host%2C%20or%20vApp.)
in the _VMware Knowledge Base_.

1. To start the target VM, click **Power** > **Power On** in the **Actions** tab for your VM.

## <a id='construct-stemcell'></a> Step 4: Constructing the BOSH stemcell

To create your BOSH stemcell, follow these steps:

1. If you are running [govc](https://github.com/vmware/govmomi/tree/master/govc), a CLI for vSphere operations,
unset any `GOVC_` environment variables before you run `stembuild construct`.<br />
For each of the following environment variables, run `echo $GOVC_VAR` to record the current setting, and then run `export GOVC_VAR=` to temporarily unset it:

* `GOVC_USERNAME`
* `GOVC_INSECURE`
* `GOVC_PASSWORD`
* `GOVC_URL`

    **Explanation**: Local `GOVC` parameters that are set to configure `govc` take precedence over
    command-line parameters that `stembuild construct` passes in to `govc`, which can cause `stembuild construct` to fail.

1. Collect the following information from the vCenter Web Client **Inventory** > **VMs and Templates** tab:
    * Target VM IP address
    * Target VM user name
    * Target VM password
    * vCenter inventory path to the target VM in the `/YOUR-DATA-CENTER/vm/YOUR-FOLDER/YOUR-VM` format, where:
      * `YOUR-DATA-CENTER` is the name of the data center.
      * `vm` is a static string.
      * `YOUR-FOLDER` is the name of the folder that contains the VM. If the target VM is not in a folder, use the `/YOUR-DATA-CENTER/vm/YOUR-VM` format instead.
      * `YOUR-VM` is the name of the target VM.
    * vCenter use name
    * vCenter password
    * vCenter URL

    The target VM must be routable from your local host. Before you run the <code>construct</code> command, you must be logged out of the target VM.

1. To construct the BOSH stemcell, run this command from the folder where you downloaded the CLI:

    ```console
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY construct  ^
      -vm-ip 'TARGET-VM-IP'  ^
      -vm-username TARGET-USERNAME  ^
      -vm-password 'TARGET-VM-PASSWORD'  ^
      -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL  ^
      -vcenter-username VCENTER-USERNAME  ^
      -vcenter-password 'VCENTER-PASSWORD'  ^
      -vm-inventory-path 'INVENTORY-PATH'  ^
      -vcenter-ca-certs 'CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH'
    ```

    Where:
        <ul>
          <li>`STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-2019-2`.</li>
          <li>`TARGET-VM-IP` is the IP address of your target VM.</li>
          <li>`TARGET-USERNAME` is the user name of an account with administrator privileges.</li>
          <li>`TARGET-VM-PASSWORD` is the password for the administrator account. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-USERNAME` is the user name of your account in vCenter.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.</li>
          <li>`INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.</li>
          <li>`CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH` is the file path to custom CA certificates for the destination vCenter. The `-vcenter-ca-certs` flag is optional.</li>
        </ul>

    For more information, see [Authenticate into a destination vCenter using CA certificates](#authenticate-using-certs)
    as follows.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY construct -vm-ip '192.0.2.254' -vm-username user001 -vm-password 'P1a2s3Sword5' -vcenter-url example.com -vcenter-username user002 -vcenter-password 'P1a2s3Sword5' -vm-inventory-path '/datacenter/vm/folder/test-vm'

    </pre>

    <p class="note caution">
    <span class="note__title">Caution</span>
    Your <code>stembuild construct</code> operation can take up to an hour to complete.
    Although the WinRM connection stops during <code>construct</code> processing,
    <code>construct</code> is still running. Do not attempt to run the <code>construct</code> command again.</p>

    This example shows the messages that appear as `stembuild construct` runs:

    <pre class="terminal">
    2020-01-01T00:00:00 Successfully created stemcell version file.
    Finished executing setup script.

    </pre>

1. (Optional) To monitor the status of your `construct` job:

    1. Log in to the target VM.

    2. Start PowerShell.

    3. Run:

        ```console
        Get-Content -Path "C:\provision\log.log" -Wait
        ```

2. Restore the values of any `govc` variables you unset previously.

For more information about `stembuild construct`, see [stembuild construct](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stembuild#stembuild-construct) in the Cloud Foundry stembuild GitHub repository.

## <a id='package-stemcell'></a> Step 5: Packaging the BOSH stemcell

To package the BOSH stemcell:

1. Gather the vCenter Web Client **VMs and Templates** information that you recorded earlier in the procedure:

  * vCenter inventory path to the target VM in the `/YOUR-DATA-CENTER/vm/YOUR-FOLDER/YOUR-VM` format, where:
    * `YOUR-DATA-CENTER` is the name of the data center.
    * `vm` is a static string.
    * `YOUR-FOLDER` is the name of the folder that contains the VM. If the target VM is not in a folder, use the `/YOUR-DATA-CENTER/vm/MY-VM` format instead.
    * `YOUR-VM` is the name of the target VM.
  * vCenter user name
  * vCenter password
  * vCenter URL

2. Stop the VM. If you do not stop the VM before you continue to the next step, the package command fails, and states that the storage location for the VM cannot be read.

3. To package the BOSH stemcell, run this PowerShell command from your local host:

    ```console
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY package ^
      -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL ^
      -vcenter-username VCENTER-USERNAME ^
      -vcenter-password VCENTER-PASSWORD ^
      -patch-version PATCH-VERSION ^
      -vm-inventory-path 'INVENTORY-PATH'  ^
      -vcenter-ca-certs 'CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH'
    ```

    Where:
        <ul>
          <li>`STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-2019-2`.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-USERNAME` is the user name of your account in vCenter.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.</li>
          <li>`PATCH-VERSION` is the patch version for the stemcell being built.</li>
          <li>`PATCH-VERSION` is an unquoted version name, for example, `2019.12.3`, or a quoted patch number, for example, `“3”`.</li>
          <li>`INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.</li>
          <li>`CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH` is the file path to custom CA certificates for the destination vCenter. The `-vcenter-ca-certs` flag is optional.For more information, see [Authenticate into a destination vCenter using CA certificates](#authenticate-using-certs).</li>
        </ul>

    This command creates a stemcell on your local host in the folder where you ran the command and can take up to 30-minutes
    to complete.

For more information about `stembuild package`, see [stembuild package](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stembuild#stembuild-package) in the Cloud Foundry stembuild GitHub repository.

## <a id='known-issues'></a> Known issues

### <a name='special-characters'></a> Authentication error with special characters in stembuild commands

**Symptom**

You authenticate with vCenter and see this error:

<pre class="terminal">
./out/stembuild: ServerFaultCode: Cannot complete login due to an incorrect user name or password.
vcenter_client - unable to validate url: vcenter.example.com
</pre>

**Explanation**

`stembuild` uses govc libraries. These libraries cannot parse the special characters `/`, `#`, and `:`. This causes errors when authenticating with vCenter.

You might also experience this issue on Windows if your password includes a single quote character, `'`. This also affects the Inventory path if it contains a single quote or a space.

**Workaround**

If your vCenter user name or password contains `/`, `#`, or `:`, or `'` on Windows, set these environment variables:

* For **Linux**:

    ```console
    export GOVC_USERNAME=VCENTER-USERNAME
    export GOVC_PASSWORD=VCENTER-PASSWORD
    ```

* For **Windows**:

    ```console
    set GOVC_USERNAME=VCENTER-USERNAME
    set GOVC_PASSWORD=VCENTER-PASSWORD
    set GOVC_PATH=VCENTER-INVENTORY-PATH
    ```

Where:

* `VCENTER-USERNAME` is your vCenter account user name. For example, `johndoe`.
* `VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your vCenter account password. For example, `pass#word`.
* `VCENTER-INVENTORY-PATH` is the location of your VM in the cluster inventory.

If you use other special characters, add single quotes around the input parameters, or set them in an environment variable.

For example:

* For **Linux**:

    ```console
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY package \
      -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL \
      -vcenter-username 'admin@' \
      -vcenter-password VCENTER-PASSWORD \
      -patch-version PATCH-VERSION \
      -vm-inventory-path 'INVENTORY-PATH' \
      -vcenter-ca-certs 'CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH'
    ```

    Where:
        <ul>
          <li>`STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-2019-2`.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your password. The password must be enclosed in single quotes.</li>
          <li>`PATCH-VERSION` is the patch version for the stemcell being built.</li>
          <li>`PATCH-VERSION` is an unquoted version name, for example, `2019.12.3`, or a quoted patch number, for example, `“3”`.</li>
          <li>`INVENTORY-PATH` is the vCenter inventory path to the target VM.</li>
          <li>`CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH` is the file path to custom CA certificates for the destination vCenter. The `-vcenter-ca-certs` flag is optional. For more information, see [Authenticate into a destination vCenter using CA certificates](#authenticate-using-certs).</li>
        </ul>

* For **Windows**:

    ```
    set GOVC_PASSWORD=VCENTER-PASSWORD
    ./STEMBUILD-BINARY package ^
      -vcenter-url VCENTER-URL ^
      -vcenter-username %GOVC_USERNAME% ^
      -vcenter-password %GOVC_PASSWORD% ^
      -patch-version PATCH-VERSION ^
      -vm-inventory-path %GOVC_PATH% ^
      -vcenter-ca-certs 'CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH'
    ```

    Where:
        <ul>
          <li>`VCENTER-PASSWORD` is your vCenter account password. For example, `A_Strange!PAssword@Here#1`.</li>
          <li>`STEMBUILD-BINARY` is the `stembuild` file for the version of your local host operating system and the version of the stemcell that you want to build. For example, `stembuild-windows-2019-2`.</li>
          <li>`VCENTER-URL` is the URL of your vCenter.</li>
          <li>`PATCH-VERSION` is the patch version for the stemcell being built. `PATCH-VERSION` is specified as an unquoted version name, for example, `2019.12.3`, or as a quoted patch number, for example, `“3”`.</li>
          <li>`CUSTOM-CERTS-PATH` is the file path to custom CA certificates for the destination vCenter. The `-vcenter-ca-certs` flag is optional. For more information, see [Authenticate into a destination vCenter using CA certificates](#authenticate-using-certs).</li>
        </ul>

    Windows environment variables do not automatically override vCenter command line parameters, so you must specify the environment variables in the vCenter command.

### <a name='authenticate-using-certs'></a> Authenticate into a destination vCenter using CA certificates

**Symptom**

You are running `stembuild` from a location outside of your destination vCenter
and `stembuild` is unable to authenticate.

**Explanation**

You are running stembuild from a location with different vCenter permissions than your
target VM.

**Solution**

You must provide `stembuild` with the CA certificates needed to authenticate into
your destination vCenter.

To stage CA certificates for `stembuild` to use to access a target VM
in the destination vCenter:

1. Open your destination vCenter home page.
1. On the bottom right, click **Download trusted root CA certificates**.
1. Copy the downloaded CA certificates to a path accessible to `stembuild`.

To use the staged CA certificates with `stembuild`, include the optional `-vcenter-ca-certs`
flag in your `stembuild` command as shown in the example `construct` and `package`
command lines.
