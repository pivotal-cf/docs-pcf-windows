You can run Windows Diego Cells in isolation segments, which are compartmentalized resource pools for Diego Cells.

Diego Cells in one isolation segment can share routing, computing, and logging resources with other Diego Cells in the same segment, and do not use resources from other isolation segments.

To run Windows Diego Cells in multiple isolation segments, you must create and
install multiple <%= vars.windows_runtime_full %> tiles and configure each to run
in a different isolation segment.

To create multiple copies of the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile, see [Replicating a tile](#replicate).

To associate a <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile with an isolation segment, so that its Diego Cells run in that segment, see [Assigning a tile to an isolation segment](#assign-isolation).


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

To run a Windows Diego Cell in a particular isolation segment, the isolation segment must already exist in the Cloud Controller database (CCDB) before the Windows Diego Cell can be assigned to it.

To create an isolation segment in the CCDB, see [Creating an isolation segment](../adminguide/isolation-segments.html#create-an-is) in _Managing isolation segments_.


## <a id='replicate'></a> Replicating a tile

To make multiple copies of the <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile that you can assign to different isolation segments, you must use the Replicator tool.

To use the Replicator tool:

1. Download the Replicator tool from the [<%= vars.windows_runtime_full %>](https://network.tanzu.vmware.com/products/pas-windows/)
   page on <%= vars.product_network %>.

1. Go to the folder into which you downloaded the Replicator tool.

1. Replicate the tile by running:

    ```console
    replicator-windows -name "TILE-NAME" -path PATH-TO-ORIGINAL -output PATH-TO-COPY
    ```

    Where:
         <ul>
            <li>`TILE-NAME` is a unique name for the new <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile. The name must be ten or fewer characters in length and contain only alphanumeric characters, dashes, underscores, and spaces.</li>
            <li>`PATH-TO-ORIGINAL` is the absolute path to the original `.pivotal` <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile you downloaded from <%= vars.product_network %>.</li>
            <li>`PATH-TO-COPY` is the absolute path for the copy of the `.pivotal` <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile that the Replicator tool produces.</li>
         </ul>

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">
    C:\Users\admin\> replicator-windows -name "Shiny Tile" ^
    -path c:\downloads\TileOriginal.pivotal ^
    -output c:\temp\TileCopy.pivotal
    </pre>

1. Install and configure the Windows isolation segment, using the new `.pivotal` file and, follow the procedures in _Installing and configuring <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %>_, starting with **Import a Product** in [Install the tile](installing.html#install).


## <a id='assign-isolation'></a> Assigning a tile to an isolation segment

To assign a <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> tile to an isolation segment:

1. Click **App Containers**.

1. Under **Segment name**, enter a name that is unique across your TAS for VMs
[Windows] deployment. This is the placement tag for your Diego Cells.

1. (Optional) To limit the number of log lines each app instance in your isolation segment can generate per second, select
**Enable** under **App log rate limit (deprecated)** and enter an integer for **Maximum app log lines
per second**. At minimum, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using the default limit of `100`.
This feature is deactivated by default.

      <p class="note">
      <span class="note__title">Note</span>
      This method of limiting log output from applications is
      deprecated. <%= vars.company_name %> recommends using the log rate limiting quota feature
      which provides more granular control over application log output.</p>

1. Click **Save**.
